# Hello

Is this thing on? This is an obsidian vault pushed through github (for version control) and vercel (for turning into a website). The idea is that the obsidian vault would be on one of the main computers in the XLab. Every piece of equipment would have a 'note' file. Supplies would have their own 'note' file as well (eg, plastic filament for the printer, etc) along with contact info for who we talk to for resupply and so on. Student collaborators would have their own page as well, etc, etc. Obsidian can be used as a kind of database when the dataview query plugin is installed (which is the case here), properties can be used to indicate if a piece of equipment has been taken away from the lab...
